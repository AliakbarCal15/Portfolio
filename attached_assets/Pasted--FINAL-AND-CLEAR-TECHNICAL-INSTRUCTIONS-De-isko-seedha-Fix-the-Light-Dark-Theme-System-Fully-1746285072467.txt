üî• FINAL AND CLEAR TECHNICAL INSTRUCTIONS (De isko seedha):
üì¢ Fix the Light/Dark Theme System Fully and Globally:

Edit
1. The dark/light mode toggle is NOT working globally.
   - You‚Äôve added the theme switch ONLY inside the "Passion" page.
   - It does NOT affect the entire site layout.
   - It does NOT update the background, text, buttons, or section styles across the Hero, About, Projects, Contact, etc.

2. MOVE the theme toggle button out of the Passion page.
   - It should be in the main layout ‚Äî ideally inside the navbar or fixed top-right corner.

3. MAKE THE THEME ACTUALLY AFFECT THE WHOLE SCREEN.
   - When I click the button, I want the **entire screen background**, text, buttons, icons, etc. to change smoothly.
   - Do NOT just flip a few classnames in one section.

4. HOW TO FIX THIS PROPERLY:
   - In `tailwind.config.js`, set:
     ```js
     darkMode: 'class'
     ```
   - Create a global `useTheme` state using React Context or simple `useState` in `App.jsx`.
   - Add a wrapper `div` around the entire app with:
     ```jsx
     <div className={darkMode ? 'dark' : ''}>
       <App />
     </div>
     ```
   - Then, apply dark and light Tailwind classes across components like:
     ```html
     className="bg-white text-black dark:bg-[#121212] dark:text-white transition-colors duration-300"
     ```

5. DESIGN REQUIREMENT:
   - Smooth, professional background transition ‚Äî not jerky.
   - Light Mode ‚Üí Clean white/gray shades
   - Dark Mode ‚Üí Deep gray or navy with white text
   - Add a toggle button with ‚òÄÔ∏è / üåô icon that actually works across the whole site

6. DO NOT keep the theme toggle inside the Passion page only. That is completely wrong UX.
   - It must be globally visible and functional
   - Should work on every page including Hero, About, Projects, etc.

7. BONUS (If Possible):
   - Add a glow/spread effect on the toggle using Tailwind or box-shadow
   - Save the selected theme to `localStorage` so it persists on refresh
‚úÖ Final Short Answer to:
Kya ab Light/Dark theme kaam kar raha hai?

No. The dark/light mode is currently broken and limited to the Passion page. I need a global theme toggle that changes the full-screen layout across all pages smoothly ‚Äî background, text, buttons, etc. The toggle must be placed in the navbar or corner and not hidden inside a specific route. Please move it out, make it global, and apply the theme system properly using Tailwind dark mode.
