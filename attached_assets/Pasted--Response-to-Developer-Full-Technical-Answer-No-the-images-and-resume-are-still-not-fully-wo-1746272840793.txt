🧾 ✅ Response to Developer (Full Technical Answer):
No, the images and resume are still not fully working as expected. Please make the following adjustments:

🖼️ 1. Image Mapping Not Correct
All three images (photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg) are in the public/ folder, but their usage in components is incorrect or mismatched.

✅ Correct usage must be:

Hero Section → <img src="/photo1.jpg" alt="Aliakbar Formal" />

About Section → <img src="/photo2.jpg" alt="Aliakbar Casual" />

Passion Page → <img src="/photo3.jpg" alt="Aliakbar with Bike" />

🛠️ Ensure these are mapped exactly as named. Do not import images from public. Use direct root path:
/photo1.jpg, /photo2.jpg, /photo3.jpg

📄 2. Resume View Still Not Working
The "View Resume" button opens a blank white iframe.

This usually means the file is either:

Not served as a proper PDF MIME type

Not placed correctly in the /public folder

Or, the iframe’s path is wrong

✅ Fix it by ensuring:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<iframe
  src="/resume.pdf"
  className="w-full h-[500px]"
  title="Aliakbar Resume"
/>
🛠️ If this still doesn’t work, fallback option:

Create a dedicated route/page /resume-view

Inside that page, embed the iframe and a download button

🌗 3. Light and Dark Mode Issue
Light/Dark mode is currently only working on the Passion page or not functional globally.

✅ I want:

Global light/dark mode toggle

Theme switch should persist across all pages

It should change background, text, button, and accent colors smoothly

Use Tailwind CSS’s dark mode setup:

darkMode: 'class' in tailwind.config.js

Use className={dark ? 'dark' : ''} wrapping <body> or <div id="root">

Toggle should use a button with sun/moon icon and toggle the class

🎨 Choose a professional, soothing theme:

Light: #f6f6f6 bg, #1a1a1a text

Dark: #121212 bg, #e2e2e2 text

Add subtle corner spreading glow effect on toggle if possible

✅ Final Answer to:
Are all the images and resume loading correctly now? What else would you like me to adjust?

No, not yet. The images are not mapped correctly (photo1, photo2, photo3 are mismatched or not rendering properly), and the resume iframe still shows a blank page. Please ensure correct public path usage. Also, implement a full-site functional light/dark theme toggle with smooth transitions and a clean color palette.
